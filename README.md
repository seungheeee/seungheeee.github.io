## About Me

This theme can be used just as other [Jekyll themes][1] and support [remote theme][12],
see [the official guide][13] as well.

You can introduce this jekyll theme into your own site by either

- [Fork][3] this repository and add your markdown posts to the `_posts` folder.
- Use as a remote theme in your [`_config.yml`][14](just like what we do for this
  site itself),

```yaml
remote_theme: sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook
```

### Experience

This theme can be ran locally using Ruby and Gemfiles.

## Skill

The search functionality in jekyll-gitbook theme is powered by the [gitbook-plugin-search-pro][5] plugin and is enabled by default.
